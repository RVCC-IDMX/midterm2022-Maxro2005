        <p id="bio">Hello there! My name is Max Romano. I have been developing websites for the past twenty years. In that time, I have worked on many different projects including Google, Outlook, and the college learning application Canvas. I have also built hundreds of personal/business sites for individuals who want to show off their abilities to the world. Alongside my website development business, I also teach Web Development I part time at Raritan Valley Community College.</p>

                <p>Max is the best website developer on the entire planet Earth! I wish I could give him a rating higher than 5!</p>

                <p>Max designed one of my friend's websites, and I have never seen anything like it. If I ever need a website in the future, I know who I'll be hiring.

                <p>Max helped me design and develop my own web page for my jewelry business from scratch. His services were affordable, and he went above and beyond my expectations. I will definitely be telling my friends who have small businesses about him.</p>
